# Project
Project in DT071G  (Programmering i C#.NET)

The project is to write an application, any application, in C# and then document the process in a report.

I have opted to write a console application that is a wordle-clone.

# Result

To run the application one needs to initiate a C# console application with the namespace project and the supplied files of the git-project.
The needed files are:
* Program.cs
* Game.cs
* Statistics.cs
* words.json
* statistics.json

With these and the namespace project the game should be possible to run on any computer with C# installed.
